# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Max Nowack. I've been working in tech for a while now, doing everything from coding to leading teams. Currently, I'm the CTO and Co-Founder of VineForecast. I'm into stuff like TypeScript, Node.js, and React. Besides technology I'm also into cooking, mushroom picking and nature in general. At the moment I'm learning a bit more about data science. I like sharing what I know and teaming up on cool projects. Check out my work and let's make something awesome together!
